# About the project
The Campus Life Perspectives project is a collaboration with [DTU Campus Service](https://www.dtu.dk/om-dtu/organisation/administration/campus_service), [ERIK Architects](https://www.erik.dk/), [The Techno-Anthropology Lab](https://www.tantlab.aau.dk/) as well asand [Polyteknisk Forening](https://www.pf.dk/) - and is part of [our] (link) thesis project in Techno-Anthropology at Aalborg University Copenhagen. The project builds on an app developed in the [Urban Belonging Project](https://urbanbelonging.com/en) and aims to test it as a new, more participatory and more data driven way of evaluating buildings and urban areas - in this case Lyngby Campus. By participating, you get a chance to voice your opinions and share experiences on life at Lyngby Campus - and hopefully help make campus a better place. The data collection part of the project will run during September, and any insights produced will be made available to our project partners. It doesn’t matter if you're just starting at university, are about to finish or if you are just visiting for a the semester - your insights are valuable to us and the [Campus Renewal Project](https://campusudvikling.dtu.dk/)!
